# Tang Nano 20K HDMI base project

A tiny little HDMI project (with a test pattern generator) implemented in Verilog/SystemVerilog for the Tang Nano 20K's FPGA, the GW2AR.

I ([@tiagosr](https://github.com/tiagosr/)) created this project to serve as a quickstart into generating HDMI with the Tang Nano 20K, and I intend to make use of it in multiple means.
